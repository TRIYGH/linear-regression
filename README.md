# linear-regression

This analysis focuses on finding the linear regression for this data, as well as finding it's R-squared score to determine whether the equation is a good fit for this data. (0.8 and greater is considered a strong correlation.)

Charting the original data and the equation data will appear in the charts.

This will facilitate any extrapolating of data:
    Ie. If the ground temperature reached 95Â° F, then at what approximate rate would you expect the crickets to be chirping?

As expected one can also interpolate the results.
